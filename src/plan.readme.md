Idea about planning:

Each room (initial and expansions) must proceed through planing phase.
Planning consists of map analysis and zone designation.
At this point all zones can be created, for now I thought up of such zones:
 * spawns - location(s) which contain spawn point and slots for initial
   builder (if required) and carrier(s) which ensure that spawn(s) have
   energy. Currently I think that extensions should a part of this zone,
   since the 'carrier' slot should be able to bring energy to extensions.
   Maybe this zone should be the owner of global builders too.
 * mines - locations centered on sources and minerals (later). Contains
   slots for 'miners', preferably a 'storage' and a 'rampant' above.
   May contain a temporary slot for 'builder'.
 * controller - location which is centered around a room controller.
   Contains slots for 'upgraders' and 'carriers'. 'storage' and 'rampant'
   are required, so temporary 'builder' may be included.
 * market - location which contains 'terminal' structure. Slots should
   contain 'carriers' and a temporary 'builder'.

For slots, read slot.readme.md
